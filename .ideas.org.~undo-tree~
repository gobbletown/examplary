i wanted to do this like 6 months ago
a compiler for gpt-3 prompts
the idea is to compose prompts
compose prompts using a DSL, it generates a prompt which is like natural language but , like a 'repeat after me' command
somehow the dsl must encapsulate things like, using question-answer pairs,
and allegory
and doing that more efficiently and more structurally than simply remembering those rules
, so the dsl makes it easier to design prompts, and it simply rolls it all together into a prompt, which is essentially just a string which is then sent to the API
the API cant return per-token probabilties and have some other settings
http://github.com/mullikine/glossaries-gh/blob/master/openai.txt
https://storage.googleapis.com/gcs-vuse/prompt-design.html
so the API streams text to you
you give it a prompt and then set the 'stop sequence'
when it generates the stop sequence, it stops
the prompt is the input text, it tries to continue the text until it generates the stop sequence
there can be multiple stop sequences
that in itself would need to be encoded into the DSL somehow
the DSL should let you not only design the prompt, but compose prompts together, prompts within prompts
one prompt per function, so functions are designed by using prompts
so you functions can be composed of other functions, or functions which are essentially prompts
there isnt a single repository online which has yet found a way to orgnise prompts effectively
https://github.com/wgryc/gpt3-prompts
this is the best ive found
also, havent found yet any website which organises them
anyway, gave u access to the repository. itd be cool if u want to work on it together. im currently just trying to curate a bunch of prompts and get some kind of emacs prototype going
if it's lisp-like then the DSL can be used inside emacs easily
it would also make it super easy to create it
the easiest first step is simply curating prompts in an organised way
putting the prompts into a database in a format which also has the settings for the prompt.
temperature, a float value from 0-1 is the creativity level
that is part of a prompt. so a prompt is a string together with the settings, such as start, stop, restart sequences and temperature
it could be a yaml file together with some settings. that would work, i guess, a lot like a tenet, i guess
its a lot simpler
the yaml file would only describe prompts, the DSL would be completely separate from that
the DSL is just listp functions. very easy, dont even need to build anything. would take 2 seconds
ill try to put these example prompts into a git repository
so what's important to figure out in the DSL is its objectives, such as that distinction i just made between yaml files and the DSL
the DSL should compile to a sequence of requests to the API
not just sequences, but should have the ability to poll for more user input
so a little interactivity as its executing would be nice
maybe. but that maybe can come later. the first steps would be to curate prompts and then see if they can be composed to make bigger prompts
and if prompts can be composed more easily (ie. generate QA pairs) using the DSL to generate prompts
a prompt can be generated (to make a new prompt-function) or can be used in an existing prompt. a prompt is essentially just a function, but theres not really any DSL yet to describe how to compose them and build bigger programs with them
or to generate prompts from non-prompt string literals.
i guess the design is the hardest part. the rest is just creating macros
designing a DSL to generate prompts, and essentially maintain libraries of prompt functions
because prompt-engineering is going to become pretty big in the future i think
The DSL is always used to generate prompts. The output of the API would be considered to be another prompt which can be used. GPT-3 can be used to generate GPT-3 prompts. That's pretty ridiculous, but true
maybe there can be a prompt description file, which is loaded into an object as a convenience. Due to the homoiconicity of lisp, there would also be a () representation of the object
the prompt description file would be yaml, i guess
but composing prompts would all be done in lisp to make it trivial
GPT-4 is on its way.... and im guessing that when its announced in a few months, people will be able to showcase their GPT-3 stuff
at the moment theres a moratorium on that
so we don't really know what's out there
i have no idea how to monetise this
or get funding or anything like that
it might be cool to reward people who contribute to the prompts library when their prompts are used
and there could be a service based on ocean protocol which means that people dont need to reveal their secret prompts when they want to execute the prompts
if those prompts rely on other prompt libraries
this is making me think i should move my eth to streamr after i sell streamr for eth
move my eth to ocean, i mean
http://github.com/mullikine/emacs-openai-api-playground/blob/master/design.org
im making an emacs playground atm
its gonna be the best openai playground :P

i wanted to do this like 6 months ago
a compiler for gpt-3 prompts
the idea is to compose prompts
compose prompts using a DSL, it generates a prompt which is like natural language but , like a 'repeat after me' command
somehow the dsl must encapsulate things like, using question-answer pairs,
and allegory
and doing that more efficiently and more structurally than simply remembering those rules
, so the dsl makes it easier to design prompts, and it simply rolls it all together into a prompt, which is essentially just a string which is then sent to the API
the API cant return per-token probabilties and have some other settings
http://github.com/mullikine/glossaries-gh/blob/master/openai.txt
https://storage.googleapis.com/gcs-vuse/prompt-design.html
so the API streams text to you
you give it a prompt and then set the 'stop sequence'
when it generates the stop sequence, it stops
the prompt is the input text, it tries to continue the text until it generates the stop sequence
there can be multiple stop sequences
that in itself would need to be encoded into the DSL somehow
the DSL should let you not only design the prompt, but compose prompts together, prompts within prompts
one prompt per function, so functions are designed by using prompts
so you functions can be composed of other functions, or functions which are essentially prompts
there isnt a single repository online which has yet found a way to orgnise prompts effectively
https://github.com/wgryc/gpt3-prompts
this is the best ive found
also, havent found yet any website which organises them
anyway, gave u access to the repository. itd be cool if u want to work on it together. im currently just trying to curate a bunch of prompts and get some kind of emacs prototype going
if it's lisp-like then the DSL can be used inside emacs easily
it would also make it super easy to create it
the easiest first step is simply curating prompts in an organised way
putting the prompts into a database in a format which also has the settings for the prompt.
temperature, a float value from 0-1 is the creativity level
that is part of a prompt. so a prompt is a string together with the settings, such as start, stop, restart sequences and temperature
it could be a yaml file together with some settings. that would work, i guess, a lot like a tenet, i guess
its a lot simpler
the yaml file would only describe prompts, the DSL would be completely separate from that
the DSL is just listp functions. very easy, dont even need to build anything. would take 2 seconds
ill try to put these example prompts into a git repository
so what's important to figure out in the DSL is its objectives, such as that distinction i just made between yaml files and the DSL
the DSL should compile to a sequence of requests to the API
not just sequences, but should have the ability to poll for more user input
so a little interactivity as its executing would be nice
maybe. but that maybe can come later. the first steps would be to curate prompts and then see if they can be composed to make bigger prompts
and if prompts can be composed more easily (ie. generate QA pairs) using the DSL to generate prompts
a prompt can be generated (to make a new prompt-function) or can be used in an existing prompt. a prompt is essentially just a function, but theres not really any DSL yet to describe how to compose them and build bigger programs with them

it might be cool to reward people who contribute to the prompts library when their prompts are used
and there could be a service based on ocean protocol which means that people dont need to reveal their secret prompts when they want to execute the prompts
if those prompts rely on other prompt libraries
this is making me think i should move my eth to streamr after i sell streamr for eth
move my eth to ocean, i mean
http://github.com/mullikine/emacs-openai-api-playground/blob/master/design.org
im making an emacs playground atm
its gonna be the best openai playground :P
i think i could beat basically anything thats out there
but having a DSL to compliment it would be awesome" 0 38 (fontified t face org-link mouse-face highlight keymap #2# help-echo #24="LINK: https://github.com/mullikine/examplary" htmlize-link #23=(:uri "https://github.com/mullikine/examplary") font-lock-multiline t wrap-prefix #1#) 38 39 (fontified t rear-nonsticky #8# face org-link mouse-face highlight keymap #2# help-echo #24# htmlize-link #23# font-lock-multiline t wrap-prefix #1#) 39 40 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 40 78 (fontified t insert-in-front-hooks #5# wrap-prefix #1#) 78 79 (fontified t display nil face default insert-in-front-hooks #5# wrap-prefix #1#) 79 109 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 109 141 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 141 263 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 263 339 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 339 353 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 353 444 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 444 500 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 500 609 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 609 682 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 682 746 (fontified t face org-link mouse-face highlight keymap #2# help-echo #26="LINK: http://github.com/mullikine/glossaries-gh/blob/master/openai.txt" htmlize-link #25=(:uri "http://github.com/mullikine/glossaries-gh/blob/master/openai.txt") font-lock-multiline t wrap-prefix #1#) 746 747 (fontified t rear-nonsticky #8# face org-link mouse-face highlight keymap #2# help-echo #26# htmlize-link #25# font-lock-multiline t wrap-prefix #1#) 747 748 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 748 806 (fontified t face org-link mouse-face highlight keymap #2# help-echo #28="LINK: https://storage.googleapis.com/gcs-vuse/prompt-design.html" htmlize-link #27=(:uri "https://storage.googleapis.com/gcs-vuse/prompt-design.html") font-lock-multiline t wrap-prefix #1#) 806 807 (fontified t rear-nonsticky #8# face org-link mouse-face highlight keymap #2# help-echo #28# htmlize-link #27# font-lock-multiline t wrap-prefix #1#) 807 808 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 808 840 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 840 895 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 895 942 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 942 1040 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 1040 1078 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 1078 1109 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 1109 1140 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 1140 1245 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 1245 1314 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 1314 1411 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 1411 1507 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 1507 1544 (fontified t face org-link mouse-face highlight keymap #2# help-echo #30="LINK: https://github.com/wgryc/gpt3-prompts" htmlize-link #29=(:uri "https://github.com/wgryc/gpt3-prompts") font-lock-multiline t wrap-prefix #1#) 1544 1545 (fontified t rear-nonsticky #8# face org-link mouse-face highlight keymap #2# help-echo #30# htmlize-link #29# font-lock-multiline t wrap-prefix #1#) 1545 1546 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 1546 1574 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 1574 1631 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 1631 1640 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 1640 1816 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 1816 1880 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 1880 1927 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 1927 1998 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 1998 2091 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 2091 2152 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 2152 2286 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 2286 2316 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 2316 2394 (fontified t wrap-prefix #1#) 2394 5274 (fontified nil)) . 1) (undo-tree-id12 . -5274) (undo-tree-id13 . -40) (undo-tree-id14 . -748) (undo-tree-id15 . -753) (undo-tree-id16 . -1507) (undo-tree-id17 . -1512)) (24619 42133 480227 294000) 0 nil]) nil nil (24619 42133 480805 608000) 0 (:register 94)] #31# 20201 5 nil)
